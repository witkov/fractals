1. At https://www.geogebra.org/geometry, select: More | Media | Image to upload image
2. Select | Basic Tools | Point
3. Click on 2 points along the longest axis of the largest crumpled ball image. 
4. Click on 2 points along the shortest axis of the same crumpled ball image.
5. Click on 2 points along a 3rd axis of the same crumpled ball image.
6. Choose Measure | Distance or Length
7. Click on 2 points along one of the above three axes and record the distance (diameter) displayed.
8. Repeat the above steps for the remaining axes and record the distances in d1.
9. Repeat the above steps for the remaining crumpled ball images.
